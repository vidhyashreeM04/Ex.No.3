Aim:

To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting
Tools Required:

• AI-based text generation platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity AI)

• Word/Excel for organizing conversations and response comparisons

• Internet access for testing AI responses (if applicable)
Theory:

Prompt engineering is a critical technique in AI chatbot development, particularly for customer service applications. It involves crafting specific inputs (prompts) to obtain desired outputs from large language models (LLMs). Different prompting techniques can greatly affect the quality, relevance, and clarity of responses. In this experiment, we focus on:

    Straightforward Prompting: o A direct method of asking questions or issuing commands. o Useful for obtaining quick, focused responses to simple user needs.
    Tabular Format Prompting: o Instructs the AI to present information in structured table form. o Ideal for presenting lists, comparisons, step-by-step guides, or status updates.
    Preceding Question Prompting: o Builds a logical flow of conversation based on the context of previous responses. o Mimics natural human interactions and improves user engagement. These prompting techniques enhance the chatbot's versatility and make it adaptable to different levels of complexity in customer service queries.

Experiment Procedure:

We simulated 3 core customer support scenarios:

    Product Troubleshooting
    Order Tracking
    General Inquiry Each scenario was tested with all three prompting techniques. The chatbot's responses were recorded and evaluated based on clarity, accuracy, user-friendliness, and contextual appropriateness.

Evaluation and Observations:

• Straightforward Prompting was very effective for direct questions like order status or simple return policies.

• Tabular Prompting gave the clearest outputs when the user needed detailed or structured info, like troubleshooting steps or multiple orders.

• Preceding Question Prompting created the best customer experience, allowing dynamic conversations that adapted based on user answers.

Thus, combining different prompting styles allows the chatbot to be both efficient and user-friendly.
Conclusion:

Thus, by applying Straightforward Prompting, Tabular Format Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting techniques, the AI-powered chatbot was able to efficiently resolve various types of customer queries while maintaining a conversational, clear, and organized tone. Different types of prompts handled different scenarios better, improving overall support effectiveness.
Result:
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
